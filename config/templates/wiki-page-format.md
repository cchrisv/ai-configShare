# Wiki Page Formatting Standards

This document defines the formatting standards for all Azure DevOps Wiki pages created by the autonomous ticket preparation workflow.

## Rich HTML Templates

Three wiki templates are available, each serving a different purpose:

| Template | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `wiki-page-template.html` | Work item ticket preparation pages | Header contains "Autonomous Ticket Preparation" or page title starts with work item ID |
| `feature-solution-design-wiki.html` | Feature solution design pages | Header contains "Feature Solution Design" or work item type is Feature/Epic |
| `wiki-general-template.html` | Any wiki page (content-agnostic pattern reference) | Fallback — any page not matching the above patterns |

All templates share a unified design system:

### Visual Hierarchy

| Element | Design | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Page header** | Gradient bar | `border-radius: 8px; padding: 14px 16px;` — page title only, no links or metadata |
| **`##` section headers** | Markdown heading + **6px** gradient accent bar | Provides TOC detection + color-coded section identity |
| **`###` subsection headers** | Markdown heading + **4px** gradient accent bar | Lighter shade of parent section color for hierarchy |
| **Content** | White bordered cards | `background: #fff; border: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px;` |
| **Callouts** | Colored left-border accent cards | `border-left: 4px solid ACCENT; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; padding: 14px;` |
| **Tables** | HTML styled (NOT markdown) | `#f8f9fa` header rows, `1px solid #dee2e6` borders, `padding: 10px` |
| **Status badges** | Colored spans | `padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 11px;` |
| **Section sub-labels** | Bold colored text | `font-weight: 600; color: COLOR; border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6;` |
| **Diagrams** | Mermaid `graph TD` | Always top-down, never left-to-right |

### Color-Coded Sections

Colors are assigned by semantic meaning of each section heading:

- 🟢 **Green** (`#2e7d32 → #1b5e20`): Executive Summary
- 🔵 **Blue** (`#1565c0 → #0d47a1`): Page header, What — The Request (subsections: `#42a5f5 → #1565c0`)
- 🟣 **Purple** (`#7b1fa2 → #4a148c`): Why — Rationale & Evidence (subsections: `#ab47bc → #7b1fa2`)
- 🔷 **Indigo** (`#303f9f → #1a237e`): How — Solution & Validation → Solution Design (subsection: `#5c6bc0 → #303f9f`)
- 🩵 **Teal** (`#00796b → #004d40`): How — Solution & Validation → Quality & Validation

Colors are defined in `shared.json` → `wiki_sections`. Subsection accent bars use the lighter shade specified in each section's `color_from`/`color_to`.

### Critical Design Rules

- `[[_TOC_]]` MUST be on its own line outside any HTML block
- Section headers MUST use markdown `##` / `###` syntax for TOC detection
- HTML blocks must be separated by blank lines from markdown content
- Each HTML block is self-contained (no wrapping `<div>` around entire page)
- **NO** `<details>/<summary>` collapsed sections — all content must be fully visible
- **NO** markdown tables — always use HTML styled tables
- Mermaid diagrams always use `graph TD` (top-down), never `graph LR`

## Writing Tone & Narrative Style

### The Voice: Knowledgeable Guide

Write as a **knowledgeable colleague sharing insights** - someone who has thoroughly investigated the problem and wants to help readers understand both the journey and the destination. The tone should be:

- **Educational without being condescending** - Explain concepts as if teaching a capable peer who simply hasn't had time to research this specific topic yet
- **Narrative-driven** - Tell the story of discovery, not just list facts. Guide readers through "what we learned and why it matters"
- **Respectful of all audiences** - Business users should understand the value and impact; technical users should find the depth they need
- **Conversational but professional** - Use "we" to create partnership, avoid jargon without explanation, and maintain warmth without sacrificing precision

### Narrative Over Lists

**Bad Example (Just Facts):**
```markdown
## Research Findings
- Found ContactTriggerHandler
- Uses Handler Pattern
- 15 references in codebase
```

**Good Example (Narrative with Context):**
```markdown
## What We Discovered

When we examined the codebase, we found that the organization has already established a solid foundation for this type of work. The `ContactTriggerHandler` class follows the Handler Pattern that the team has standardized on - this is good news because it means we can extend existing patterns rather than introducing something unfamiliar.

We traced 15 references to this handler throughout the codebase, which tells us two important things: first, any changes here will need careful testing since the impact radius is significant; second, the pattern is well-established and trusted by the team.

| Component | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| ContactTriggerHandler | Orchestrates contact-related automation | Our entry point - we'll extend this rather than create something new |
```

### Balancing Business and Technical Audiences

Each section should work on two levels:

1. **Lead with business context** - Start with why this matters, what problem it solves, or what value it delivers
2. **Follow with technical depth** - Provide the specifics in tables, code references, or callout cards for those who need them

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
### Why We Chose This Approach

After evaluating our options, we determined that extending the existing Flow framework gives us the best balance of speed and maintainability. This approach means the team can deliver the feature within the sprint while keeping future enhancements straightforward.

For the technically curious, here's how the options compared:

<!-- All content is fully visible — no collapsed sections -->
<div style="background: #fff; border: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #333;">
  <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
    <tr style="background: #f8f9fa;">
      <td style="padding: 10px; font-weight: 600; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Option</td>
      <td style="padding: 10px; font-weight: 600; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Approach</td>
      <td style="padding: 10px; font-weight: 600; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Trade-offs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Option A</td>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">...</td>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">...</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
```

### Phrases to Use and Avoid

**Use:**
- "We discovered that..." / "Our investigation revealed..."
- "This matters because..." / "The key insight here is..."
- "Here's what this means in practice..."
- "For those interested in the details..." / "Diving deeper..."
- "The good news is..." / "One thing to watch for..."

**Avoid:**
- "Obviously..." / "Simply..." / "Just..." (condescending)
- "As everyone knows..." (assumes knowledge)
- "It should be noted that..." (bureaucratic)
- Unexplained acronyms on first use
- Technical jargon without context for business readers

## Azure DevOps Wiki-Specific Requirements

Azure DevOps Wiki uses a specific flavor of markdown with important differences from standard markdown:

### Critical ADO Wiki Rules

1. **HTML Support** - ADO Wiki DOES support HTML in wiki pages (unlike pull requests)
   - ✅ HTML tags allowed: `<div>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<p>`, `<br/>`, `<span>`, `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
   - ❌ **Do NOT use** `<details>/<summary>` — all content must be fully visible
   - ⚠️ **Avoid hardcoded colors in markdown blocks** — use inline styles on HTML elements instead
   - ✅ Video embedding: `<video src="url" width=400 controls>`
   - ✅ Use HTML for styled content cards, tables, callouts, and accent bars

2. **Link Format** - Use standard markdown links, NOT wiki-specific syntax
   - ✅ `[Link Text](Page-Path)` - Standard markdown
   - ❌ `[[Link Text]]` - MediaWiki style (not supported)

3. **Tables** - Use HTML styled tables (NOT markdown) for consistent styling
   ```html
   <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
     <tr style="background: #f8f9fa;">
       <td style="padding: 10px; font-weight: 600; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Header 1</td>
       <td style="padding: 10px; font-weight: 600; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Header 2</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Value 1</td>
       <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;">Value 2</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   ```

4. **Code Blocks** - Use lowercase language identifiers
   ```markdown
   ```apex
   // Apex code here
   ```
   ```

5. **Table of Contents** - Use ADO Wiki's automatic TOC
   ```markdown
   [[_TOC_]]
   ```

6. **Content Cards** - Wrap all prose and tables in white bordered cards
   ```html
   <div style="background: #fff; border: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #333;">
     <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7;">Content goes inside cards for clean presentation.</p>
   </div>
   ```

### Mermaid Diagrams
- Wrap diagrams with `::: mermaid` and close with `:::`.
- **Do NOT use `%%{init...}%%` or `classDef` styling.** These are not fully supported in ADO Wiki and break in Dark Mode.
- Use standard Mermaid node shapes to distinguish element types:
  - `([Start/End])` for terminators
  - `{{Decision}}` for logic checks
  - `[[Subprocess]]` for major actions
  - `[(Database)]` for storage
- Always use `graph TD` (top-down), never `graph LR` (avoid `flowchart`).
- Keep node labels concise.

#### Diagram Example
```markdown
::: mermaid
graph TD
  trigger([Trigger]) --> assess{{Decision}}
  assess -->|Yes| happy[Primary Path]
  assess -->|No| alternate[Fallback]
  happy --> done([Outcome])
  alternate --> notify[[Notify Stakeholders]]
  notify --> done
:::
```

> **Diagram cadence:** Provide at least one diagram in each major section (What, Why, How) to reinforce comprehension.

## Page Structure — What / Why / How

The wiki uses a scaffolded structure. Phase 01 publishes the full skeleton; subsequent phases fill in sections by replacing placeholder content between `<!-- SECTION:id -->` markers. Section IDs and metadata are defined in `shared.json` → `wiki_sections`.

```

## 🎯 Executive Summary

[Begin with 2-3 sentences that tell the story: what's the situation, what did we discover, and what do we recommend? Write this as if explaining to a colleague over coffee.]

**The Challenge We're Addressing:**
[Describe the business problem in plain language. What pain point or opportunity prompted this work? Who is affected and how?]

**What We Learned:**
[Summarize the key discoveries from research. What surprised us? What confirmed our assumptions? What changed our thinking?]

**Our Recommended Approach:**
[Explain the solution in terms of value delivered, not technical implementation. What will be different when this is complete?]

**The Path Forward:**
[Set expectations: complexity level, key dependencies, and any important considerations for planning.]

> **Note:** This section is initially populated during Grooming (Phase 02b) with challenge + discoveries, then finalized during Solutioning (Phase 03b) with the recommended approach and path forward.

## 📋 What — The Request

### 🎯 Business Context

[Open with a narrative that puts the reader in the shoes of the people who need this. Who are they? What are they trying to accomplish? What's standing in their way?]

**The People This Affects:**
[Write about the stakeholders as real people with real challenges, not just "users." What does their day look like? What frustrates them about the current situation?]

**The Current Situation:**
[Describe where things stand today - not just technically, but in terms of the human experience. What works? What doesn't? Why is now the right time to address this?]

**What Success Looks Like:**
[Paint a picture of the future state in terms the stakeholders would use. How will their experience be different? What will they be able to do that they can't do today?]

### 📊 Requirements & Scope

[Transition into requirements with context: "Based on what we learned about the team's needs, here's what the solution must accomplish..."]

**Functional Requirements:**
[Frame these in terms of user value, not just technical capabilities. "Users need to be able to..." not just "System shall..."]

**Quality Attributes:**
[Explain why these matter: "Given the volume of records involved, performance is critical because..." not just "Response time < 2 seconds"]

**Out of Scope:**
[Explicitly call out what is NOT included in this work item to set clear boundaries.]

### 🏆 Success Criteria

[Link acceptance criteria to measurable outcomes. Each criterion should be testable and trace back to a business need.]

**Acceptance Criteria Scenarios:**

**Our Testing Philosophy:**
[Explain the reasoning behind test case selection - what we prioritized and why. Help readers understand the coverage strategy.]

---

### 🎯 AC-Centric Test Coverage Matrix

This matrix ensures every Acceptance Criteria has both happy path AND unhappy path test coverage. No AC is considered fully covered without both.

| AC ID | Acceptance Criteria | Happy Path Tests | Unhappy Path Tests | Coverage Status |
|:-----:|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|:---------------:|
| AC-1 | [First acceptance criterion] | TC-001, TC-002 | TC-005, TC-006 | ✅ Full |
| AC-2 | [Second acceptance criterion] | TC-003 | TC-007 | ✅ Full |
| AC-3 | [Third acceptance criterion] | TC-004 | — | ⚠️ Partial |
| AC-4 | [Fourth acceptance criterion] | — | — | ❌ Gap |

> **Coverage Legend:**
> - ✅ **Full** = Has at least one Happy Path test AND one Unhappy Path test
> - ⚠️ **Partial** = Has only Happy Path OR only Unhappy Path tests (requires justification)
> - ❌ **Gap** = No test coverage (blocker - must be addressed)

**Path Type Definitions:**
| Path Type | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|:------:|-------------|
| Happy Path | ✓ | Validates AC works as expected under normal conditions with valid inputs |
| Negative | ✗ | Validates error handling, invalid inputs, permission failures, missing data |
| Edge Case | ⚡ | Validates boundary conditions, bulk operations, timing, concurrent access |
| Security | 🔒 | Validates access controls, data isolation, FLS/CRUD enforcement, sharing rules |

**Coverage Notes:**
- **AC-3 (Partial):** [Explanation of what's covered and what's not, and why - e.g., "No negative test because feature degrades gracefully with no user-facing error"]
- **AC-4 (Gap):** [Explanation of why no test exists and recommended action]

### 🚀 Smoke Test Pack

Minimum post-deployment verification checklist. These checks confirm "the org is healthy after deployment" — they are intentionally shallow and fast.

> ⚠️ **Purpose:** Run these checks immediately after deployment to verify basic functionality. The full test suite (P1/P2/P3 above) provides comprehensive coverage.

| # | Check | What to Verify | Pass Criteria |
|:-:|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Login + Navigation** | Core app loads, affected tabs/pages accessible | No errors, pages render, menus work |
| 2 | **Create Key Record** | Create/update records affected by the change | Record saves successfully, fields populated correctly |
| 3 | **Automation Sanity** | Routing, assignment, approval rules fire | Expected automation triggers, correct outcomes |
| 4 | **Integration Handshake** | External system queues, logging, event delivery | No errors in integration logs, events published/received |
| 5 | **Report/Dashboard** | Representative report loads (if applicable) | Data displays correctly, no timeouts |

**Smoke Pack Principles:**
- **Shallow** — confirms basic health, not full coverage
- **Fast** — entire pack completes in <15 minutes
- **Independent** — each check runs in any order
- **Repeatable** — same results on repeated execution

| [Assumption 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [How to verify] |
| [Assumption 2] | [High/Med/Low] | [How to verify] |

### 📋 Assumptions Resolution Log

This tracks all assumptions made during research and grooming, showing how each was validated, refuted, or remains open.

| Assumption | Phase Identified | Source | Status | Resolution Evidence |
|------------|-----------------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| [Initial assumption about system behavior] | Research | [ADO/Wiki/Code] | ✅ Validated | [What confirmed this assumption] |

> **Status Legend:** ✅ Validated (confirmed true), ❌ Refuted (proved false), ⚠️ Open (needs verification), 🔄 Superseded (replaced by better understanding)

### 🔧 Quality Corrections Applied

During the autonomous preparation process, several quality gates identified and corrected issues:

#### Solution Bias Removed

Technical implementation details were moved from requirements to assumptions to maintain solution neutrality:

| Original Content | Where Found | Moved To | Category |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| [Technical term like "LWC component"] | Description | Assumptions | solution_scent |
| [API name or specific technology] | Acceptance Criteria | Assumptions | solution_scent |
| [Database/field reference] | Requirements | Assumptions | implementation_detail |

#### Template Fidelity Corrections

| Issue Detected | Auto-Correction Applied | Section Affected |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| [Missing standard section] | [Added required section from template] | [Section name] |
| [Non-compliant formatting] | [Reformatted to match standard] | [Section name] |

#### Logical Fallacies Challenged

| Fallacy Type | Original Statement | Challenge Question Added | Resolution |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Appeal to Tradition | "We've always done it this way" | "Is this still the best approach given current capabilities?" | [How it was addressed] |
| False Dilemma | "We must use X or nothing" | "What other options exist that weren't considered?" | [Additional options identified] |
| Bandwagon | "Everyone uses this approach" | "Is this approach appropriate for our specific context?" | [Context-specific evaluation] |

> **Note:** Logical fallacy detection helps ensure decisions are based on sound reasoning rather than cognitive biases.

### ❓ Open Unknowns

These items could not be determined during autonomous preparation and require human input:

| Unknown | Why We Couldn't Determine | Impact if Unresolved | Suggested Resolution Path |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| [Specific unknown] | [What prevented determination] | [Risk level and affected areas] | [Who to ask or how to find out] |

## 🎨 Section-Specific Formatting

### The Narrative-First Principle

Every section should **lead with narrative context** before presenting structured data. Tables and bullets are supporting evidence for the story, not the story itself.

**Pattern to Follow:**
1. **Opening narrative** (2-4 sentences) - Set context, explain why this matters
2. **Key insight callout** - The most important takeaway for skimmers
3. **Supporting detail** - Tables, lists, or callout cards for depth
4. **Transition** - Connect to what comes next

### What — The Request Sections
- **Lead with** who benefits and why this work matters to them
- **Support with** requirements tables and criteria lists
- **Tone:** Advocate for the user — "The team currently struggles with… and this impacts…"

### Why — Business Value & Discovery Sections
- **Lead with** what we learned and why it matters
- **Support with** tables for metadata/components found
- **Tone:** Curious colleague sharing discoveries — "When we dug into the codebase, we found something interesting…"

### Why — Investigation Trail Sections
- **Lead with** the narrative of how our understanding evolved
- **Support with** hypothesis tables (✅/❌/⚠️ outcomes)
- **Tone:** Research journal — "We started by asking… which led us to discover…"

### Why — Decision Rationale Sections
- **Lead with** the story of evaluation — what made this decision interesting
- **Support with** options comparison tables and callout cards for detail
- **Tone:** Transparent decision-maker — "We had three viable paths. Here's why we went with…"

### How — Solution Design Sections
- **Lead with** the "why" behind architectural choices
- **Support with** component tables and diagrams
- **Tone:** Experienced mentor — "We chose this approach because… here's how the pieces fit together…"

#### Solution Design Sub-sections (scale by complexity)

**🏗️ Architecture Overview** (always)
- 2-4 sentence narrative: what the solution does, why this approach, how pieces connect
- Reference the recommended option from why_decisions

**📦 Components** (always)
- Table: Component ID | Name | Type | Complexity | Responsibility
- For Complex components, add a "Key Methods" sub-table (see Method Design below)

**🔗 Integration Points** (always, when integration exists)
- Table: Source | Target | Mechanism | Contract
- Or narrative if only 1-2 simple integrations

**📋 Implementation Phases** (Medium + Complex)
- Table: Phase | Goal | Key Steps | Dependencies
- Mermaid `graph TD` showing phase dependency order (from `mermaid_diagrams` type=implementation_order)

**🗂️ Field-Level Mapping** (when solution modifies sObject fields)
- Group by operation with separate tables:
  - Fields Reset: API Name | Type | Before | After
  - Fields Computed: API Name | Type | Before | After
  - Fields Removed: API Name | Reason

**🗑️ Legacy Cleanup** (when replacing/heavily modifying existing code)
- Critical Issues table: Category | Description
- Dead Code Inventory table: Type (method/variable/map/class) | Name | Reason
- Summary: "What is NOT carried over and why"

**🔧 Method Design** (Complex components only)
- Table: Method | Visibility | Parameters | Return Type | CC Target | Nesting Limit | Pattern
- Include extracted helper methods
- Skip for Simple/Medium — responsibility field is sufficient

**📊 Diagrams** (always ≥1)
- Component interaction diagram (always) — shows entry point, helpers, data flow, external systems
- Implementation order diagram (Complex) — shows phase dependencies and parallel tracks
- Data flow diagram (optional) — shows transformation pipeline
- All diagrams from `mermaid_diagrams[]` in ticket-context.json

**🔗 AC ↔ Component Traceability** (always)
- Table: AC ID | Description | Component IDs
- Flag any gaps or orphans

### How — Quality & Validation Sections
- **Lead with** what success looks like in business terms
- **Support with** acceptance criteria, test coverage matrices, test cases
- **Tone:** Quality advocate — "We'll know this works when… and we've already addressed these concerns…"

### Bridging Business and Technical Audiences

| Audience | What They Need | How to Serve Them |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Business Stakeholders | Value, impact, timelines | Lead every section with business context, avoid unexplained jargon |
| Technical Reviewers | Depth, specifics, rationale | Provide detail in callout cards and sub-label sections, reference standards explicitly |
| Future Maintainers | Context, reasoning, gotchas | Document "why" not just "what", flag areas of uncertainty |

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### NEVER Use
- ❌ MediaWiki links (`[[Page Name]]`)
- ❌ Uppercase language identifiers in code blocks

## 📋 Callout Boxes

Use blockquotes for important notes (no HTML, use markdown bold):

```markdown
> ⚠️ **Important:** This assumption requires validation with the Banner integration team before implementation.

> 💡 **Key Insight:** Existing ContactTriggerHandler already has similar filtering logic that can be reused.

> 🚨 **Risk:** Performance degradation possible if filter criteria return >2000 records.
```

**Note:** Each line of a multi-line blockquote needs its own `>` prefix in ADO Wiki.

## Page Footer Template

Every page must end with this footer (wrapped in `<!-- SECTION:footer -->` markers):

```markdown
---

📅 **Last Updated:** [ISO 8601 timestamp]
Documentation generated by AI-assisted workflow.
```

## Example: Well-Formatted Wiki Page

```markdown
<!-- Page header gradient bar with work item ID + title -->

[[_TOC_]]

<!-- Status Banner -->
📊 **Grooming** ✅ | **Research** ✅ | **Solutioning** ✅ | **Testing** ✅

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**The Challenge:** Users need to filter Contacts by status and affiliation to improve data quality and user experience.

**What We Learned:** Existing ContactTriggerHandler already has filtering logic we can extend.

**Our Approach:** Build a reusable filtering component leveraging existing patterns with performance optimization.

**The Path Forward:** Moderate complexity with reusable components for future projects.

---

## 📋 What — The Request

Student Services advisors currently export contacts to Excel for filtering — a time-consuming process that delays enrollment outreach. With enrollment season approaching, improving data quality by 40% is critical.

### 📊 Requirements & Scope

- Filter contacts by status with instant results
- Save filter preferences for future sessions
- Export filtered data to CSV format

### 🏆 Success Criteria

AC scenarios traced to quality gates and definition of done.

---

## � Why — Rationale & Evidence

### � Business Value & Impact

Strategic alignment with enrollment efficiency initiative. Reduces manual effort for 15+ advisors.

### 🔍 Discovery & Research

- Prior filtering implementations in Student module
- Reusable status picker component available
- Integration with Banner system for data sync

### 🔬 Investigation Trail

Assumptions tested: ContactTriggerHandler supports extension (✅ Confirmed). Confidence: High.

### ⚖️ Decision Rationale

Chose to extend existing Apex + LWC patterns over building net-new. TEA score: 8.5/10.

---

## 🛠️ How — Solution & Validation

### 🏛️ Solution Design

The solution replaces the legacy `JourneyPipelineStatisticsService` with a streamlined, single-pass Apex service. We chose to rebuild rather than patch because the existing implementation has 6 critical issues including dead code paths, stale statistics, and CC > 30 methods.

#### 📦 Components

| ID | Name | Type | Complexity | Responsibility |
|----|------|------|------------|----------------|
| C1 | JourneyPipelineStatisticsService | Apex Service | Complex | Orchestrate pipeline statistics calculation via single SOQL + map-based accumulation |
| C2 | JourneyPipelineStatsBatch | Batch Apex | Medium | Nightly recalculation for large data volumes |

#### 📋 Implementation Phases

| Phase | Goal | Key Steps | Dependencies |
|-------|------|-----------|--------------|
| P1 | Core refactor | Replace nested loops with map accumulation, extract helpers | None |
| P2 | Field cleanup | Reset stale fields, remove dead code | P1 |
| P3 | Batch support | Add batch wrapper for nightly runs | P1 |

#### 🔧 Method Design (C1 — Complex)

| Method | Visibility | CC Target | Pattern |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `calculate()` | public | ≤ 8 | Guard clause + map accumulation |
| `buildStageMap()` | private | ≤ 4 | Map factory with null-safe defaults |

#### 📊 Diagrams

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Trigger Entry] --> B[JourneyPipelineStatisticsService]

## Common Formatting Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use `[[Wiki Links]]` format - use standard markdown `[text](path)` instead
- Forget blank lines before lists
- Use uppercase language identifiers in code blocks (use `apex` not `Apex`)
- Use unencoded ampersands in URLs (use `&amp;`)
- Include raw URLs without link text
- Mix emoji styles inconsistently
- Create orphan pages with no navigation
- Use absolute wiki paths (use relative)
- Leave placeholder text like [TODO] or [TBD]
- Use spaces in wiki paths (use hyphens or URL-encode)
- Overuse HTML when markdown would work better
- **Include direct URLs to work items or wiki pages** - they break easily
- **Reference local file paths** (`.ai-artifacts/`, `.github/`, `#file:`)
- **Include timeline or sprint estimates** - these belong in work items
- **Include implementation plans or step-by-step guides** - focus on design, not how to build
- **Reference artifact files** (`solution-output.json` or any JSON file names)
- **Leave test cases as external references** - embed them directly

✅ **DO:**
- Prefer markdown, use HTML sparingly for special effects
- Add blank line before every list
- Use lowercase language identifiers: `apex`, `javascript`, `python`
- Apply emoji standards consistently
- Provide clear navigation paths
- Include generation timestamps
- Fill all placeholders before saving
- Test blockquotes render correctly (use `>` per line)
- Use `[[_TOC_]]` for automatic table of contents
- Use content cards, callout cards, and accent bars for visual hierarchy
- **Direct users to check Links tab** instead of including direct URLs
- **Reference work item numbers** (e.g., "#12345") instead of full URLs
- **Embed all test cases and test data directly in the wiki**
- **Include full traceability matrix linking AC to test cases**
- **Use visual priority indicators** (🔴 P1, 🟡 P2, 🟢 P3) for test cases
