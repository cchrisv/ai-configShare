## Field Descriptions

### Top-Level Fields

- **version**: Schema version for future compatibility
- **current_pass**: Current iteration pass number across all sub-phases
- **global_clue_register**: Accumulated clues across all sub-phases
- **sub_phase_status**: Status tracking for each research sub-phase
- **feedback_loops_executed**: Log of all feedback loops executed
- **total_loop_count**: Total number of feedback loops executed (safety limit tracking)
- **iteration_limits**: Configuration limits (loaded from research-orchestration.json)
- **limits_hit**: Array of limit violations encountered
- **research_metrics**: Aggregated metrics for analysis
- **last_updated**: ISO timestamp of last update

### Global Clue Register

Tracks clues discovered across all sub-phases:

- **keywords**: Technical terms, acronyms, concepts
- **entities**: Objects, flows, classes, integrations
- **contradictions**: Conflicting information between sources
- **gaps**: Missing evidence that could be filled
- **questions**: Unanswered questions needing investigation

Each clue entry includes:
- Discovery source (`discovered_in`)
- Investigation sources (`investigated_in`)
- Confidence level (0.0-1.0)
- Status (`investigated`, `uninvestigated`, `partially_investigated`)

### Sub-Phase Status

For each sub-phase, tracks:
- **passes**: Number of times this sub-phase was executed
- **complete**: Boolean indicating completion
- **revisited_by**: Array of sub-phases that triggered revisits to this one
- **loop_count**: Number of feedback loops executed for this sub-phase
- **pending_revisits**: Array of sub-phases queued for revisit (if incomplete)
- **last_completed** / **last_updated**: ISO timestamp

### Feedback Loops Executed

Each entry logs:
- **loop_number**: Sequential loop number
- **timestamp**: When the loop was executed
- **from**: Sub-phase that triggered the loop
- **to**: Sub-phase that was revisited
- **reason**: Human-readable reason for the revisit
- **trigger**: Which of the 5 trigger criteria was met
- **findings**: Array of findings from the revisit
- **research_complete_after_loop**: Whether research was complete after this loop

### Research Metrics

Aggregated statistics:
- **total_duration_minutes**: Total research phase duration
- **sub_phases_executed**: Number of sub-phases executed
- **total_iterations**: Total number of iterations across all sub-phases
- **iterations_by_sub_phase**: Breakdown by sub-phase
- **clues_discovered/investigated/uninvestigated**: Clue statistics
- **contradictions_found/resolved**: Contradiction tracking
- **iteration_limits_hit**: Number of times limits were reached

## Usage

This artifact is:
1. **Created** at the start of the research phase
2. **Updated** after each sub-phase execution
3. **Updated** after each feedback loop execution
4. **Read** to determine iteration state and prevent infinite loops
5. **Analyzed** for research quality metrics

## Integration

- **Created by:** Research Orchestrator initialization
- **Updated by:** Each research sub-phase after execution
- **Read by:** Feedback loop evaluation logic
- **Used by:** Runner.js iteration functions
- **Referenced by:** Research summary generation

## Best Practices

1. **Always update** the artifact after each sub-phase completes
2. **Track all clues** in the global register, even if not immediately investigated
3. **Document all loops** with clear reasons and findings
4. **Respect limits** and document when limits are hit
5. **Update metrics** continuously for accurate reporting
6. **Preserve history** - don't overwrite, append to arrays
