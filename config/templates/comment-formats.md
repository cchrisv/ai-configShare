# Comment Formatting Standards - DEPRECATED

**STATUS: DEPRECATED - Comments are no longer posted by the autonomous workflow.**

## Policy

Comments are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** throughout the entire autonomous ticket preparation workflow unless explicitly requested by the user.

All documentation and communication is now handled through:
- **Wiki Pages** - Comprehensive documentation for each work item
- **Work Item Fields** - Description, Acceptance Criteria, Development Summary
- **Audit Task** - Child task linked to parent with completion status

## Historical Reference

This file previously contained HTML formatting standards for work item comments. These formats are no longer used as the workflow no longer posts any comments.

If a user explicitly requests a comment to be posted, use standard HTML formatting following these principles:
- Use semantic HTML (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>`)
- Use `<strong>` for emphasis (not `<b>`)
- Keep content brief and reference the wiki for details

---

*Last Updated: Comments removed from workflow - all documentation now lives in wiki and work item fields.*
