# WSJF Scoring Anchors

This template provides evidence-based anchor tables for scoring WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) components. Use these anchors to ensure consistent, objective scoring across all work item types.

## Overview

**Formula:** `WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) ÷ Job Duration`

**Scale:** Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20)

**Applies To:** Bug, Defect, User Story, Enhancement

---

## Business Value (BV) - Fibonacci 1-20

Business Value measures the relative value delivered to users or the business. Score based on the highest applicable anchor.

### User Stories / Enhancements

| Score | Anchor Description | Evidence Indicators |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **20** | Strategic initiative with executive sponsor, revenue-critical, competitive differentiator | Exec sponsor named, revenue projection attached, OKR alignment documented |
| **13** | Major capability for many users, significant competitive advantage, addresses critical gap | 100+ users impacted, market analysis provided, strategic roadmap item |
| **8** | Significant improvement with measurable efficiency gain, clear user demand | Efficiency metrics defined (e.g., "saves 2 hrs/day"), user feedback documented |
| **5** | Moderate improvement with clear value, workaround currently exists | Clear use case, workaround documented but inefficient |
| **3** | Minor enhancement, nice-to-have, low user visibility | Limited user base, cosmetic improvement, incremental polish |
| **2** | Very minor enhancement, single user request | Individual request, no broader impact identified |
| **1** | Cosmetic only, low visibility, no measurable impact | Formatting, minor UI tweaks, documentation only |

### Bugs / Defects

| Score | Anchor Description | Evidence Indicators |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **20** | Revenue/Data Loss, System Down, Security Breach, FERPA/Compliance violation | Incident ticket, revenue impact quantified, compliance team involved |
| **13** | Core function broken for many users, no workaround | 100+ users blocked, ITWorksEscalation tag, no alternative path |
| **8** | Major inconvenience, SLA at risk, degraded experience | SLA metrics attached, user complaints documented |
| **5** | Moderate impact, workaround exists but cumbersome | Workaround documented, moderate user friction |
| **3** | Minor impact, easy workaround available | Simple workaround, limited user impact |
| **2** | Very minor issue, rarely encountered | Edge case, infrequent reproduction |
| **1** | Cosmetic, typo, pixel-level, no functional impact | Visual-only, no workflow impact |

---

## Time Criticality (TC) - Fibonacci 1-20

Time Criticality measures how urgency changes the value over time. Score based on deadline pressure and consequences of delay.

| Score | Anchor Description | Evidence Indicators |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **20** | Regulatory/compliance deadline, security-critical (CVSS ≥ 9), contractual obligation with penalties | Compliance date documented, security advisory, contract reference |
| **13** | Release blocker, PI commitment, stakeholder deadline with business consequences | PI/Sprint goal, stakeholder communication, release dependency |
| **8** | Sprint commitment, approaching SLA threshold, user-facing degradation trending | Sprint planning evidence, SLA dashboard, escalation trend |
| **5** | Internal deadline, roadmap commitment, planning dependency | Roadmap reference, internal milestone |
| **3** | Desired but flexible timeline, nice-to-have for upcoming release | Soft target date, flexible scope |
| **2** | Low time sensitivity, can be deferred | No deadline mentioned, evergreen |
| **1** | No time sensitivity, evergreen backlog item | Explicitly flexible, tech debt cleanup |

### TC Guardrail: Date/Event Requirement

If TC >= 8, evidence must include one of:
- Specific date or event reference
- Sprint/PI commitment documented
- SLA threshold with metrics
- Regulatory deadline citation

**If no date/event evidence exists:** Downgrade TC to 5 and add warning.

---

## Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement (RR/OE) - Fibonacci 1-13

RR/OE measures how this work reduces risk or enables future opportunities. Score based on downstream impact.

| Score | Anchor Description | Evidence Indicators |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **13** | Unblocks critical path for other work, enables major release, security remediation | Dependency chain documented, blocked items listed, security advisory |
| **8** | Reduces significant technical debt, enables multiple future features, prevents incident recurrence | Tech debt metrics, feature roadmap dependency, incident correlation |
| **5** | Enables future improvements, modest risk reduction, cleanup with benefits | Future work referenced, moderate risk reduction |
| **3** | Minor risk reduction, localized cleanup, incremental improvement | Cleanup scope limited, no downstream dependencies |
| **2** | Very minor risk reduction, isolated fix | Single-point fix, no broader impact |
| **1** | Standalone work, no downstream impact | Self-contained, no dependencies or enablement |

### RR/OE Guardrail: Named Risk Type Requirement

If RR/OE >= 8, evidence must include at least one named risk type:
- **Security:** Vulnerability remediation, access control improvement
- **Compliance:** Regulatory requirement, audit finding
- **Data Integrity:** Data corruption prevention, accuracy improvement
- **Incident Recurrence:** Root cause fix, repeat incident prevention

**If no named risk type exists:** Add warning and require justification.

## Job Duration (JD) - Fibonacci 1-13

Job Duration is the fourth WSJF dimension and doubles as Story Points for sprint planning. It measures relative effort/size.

### Calculation Algorithm

Job Duration is calculated from three factors:

| Factor | Range | Scoring Criteria |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Complexity** | 1-3 | Low=1, Medium=2, High=3 (from solution-output.json) |
| **Risk** | 0-3 | +1 per Well-Architected Pillar Score ≤2; +1 if "High-Risk" tag |
| **Uncertainty** | 0-3 | +1 if Low Confidence Assumptions > 0; +1 if Traceability Gaps > 0 |

**Sum Calculation:** `Score = Complexity + Risk + Uncertainty`

**Fibonacci Mapping:**

| Sum | Job Duration |
|-----|--------------|
| 0-1 | **1** |
| 2 | **2** |
| 3 | **3** |
| 4-5 | **5** |
| 6-7 | **8** |
| 8+ | **13** |

### Anchor Descriptions

| JD Score | Description | Time Estimate |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **1** | Trivial change, single component, no dependencies | < 1 day |
| **2** | Simple change, clear scope, minimal testing | 1-2 days |
| **3** | Moderate complexity, some dependencies, standard testing | 3-5 days |
| **5** | Complex change, multiple components, significant testing | 1-2 weeks |
| **8** | Very complex, high uncertainty, extensive testing | 2-3 weeks |
| **13** | Extremely complex, multiple unknowns, full regression | 3+ weeks |

### Evidence Indicators

For Job Duration scoring, gather evidence for:
- **Complexity:** Number of components modified, integration points, similar past work
- **Risk:** Well-Architected pillar scores, High-Risk tag presence
- **Uncertainty:** Assumption confidence levels, traceability gaps, unknowns count

---

## Confidence Rating

For each dimension, assign a confidence level:

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **High** | Clear evidence, quantified metrics, validated assumptions |
| **Medium** | Reasonable evidence, some estimation, minor assumptions |
| **Low** | Limited evidence, significant estimation, unvalidated assumptions |

---

## WSJF Score Interpretation

| WSJF Range | Priority | Class of Service | Action |
|------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| ≥ 15.0 | 1 | Expedite + WSJF-Blocker | War room - stop everything |
| 8.0 – 14.9 | 1 | ExpediteCandidate | Fix this sprint (skip backlog) |
| 4.0 – 7.9 | 2 | ExpediteCandidate | Fix next sprint (skip backlog) |
| 1.5 – 3.9 | 3 | Standard | Normal backlog prioritization |
| < 1.5 | 4 | Standard | Backlog or icebox |

---

## Example Scoring

**Scenario:** Journey Pipeline configuration not updating after stage change

| Component | Score | Evidence | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Business Value | 13 | 100+ Enrollment Advisors impacted, no workaround, ITWorksEscalation | High |
| Time Criticality | 8 | Sprint commitment, SLA at risk | Medium |
| Risk Reduction | 8 | Fixes same root cause as 2 other defects (incident recurrence) | High |
| Job Duration | 3 | Moderate complexity, single flow modification | High |

**Calculation:** WSJF = (13 + 8 + 8) / 3 = **9.67**

**Result:** Priority 1, Class = ExpediteCandidate, Human Review Required

---

## Human Override

When humans override WSJF scores:

1. Original score is preserved in `wsjf-evidence.json`
2. Override reason is required (one sentence minimum)
3. Subsequent re-scoring flags if recalculated differs by > 25%
4. Override persists until explicitly removed

**Override Format:**
```json
{
  "appliedBy": "Human",
  "appliedAt": "2026-02-02T12:00:00Z",
  "originalScore": 8.67,
  "newScore": 12.0,
  "reason": "Stakeholder escalation - exec sponsor requires Q2 delivery"
}
```
