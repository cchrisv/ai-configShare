# Core Competencies

Team performance competencies assessed through activity data. Used by the activity report narrative to map observed behaviors to growth areas.

## Competency Signal Map

## Thought Leadership

Establishing yourself as a thought leader in your industry, technology and/or skillset builds your personal brand, highlights credibility, and defines you as a trusted advisor.

## Adherence

Adhere to the processes, policies, and standards the team has implemented. Each team member will be assessed on their ability to evaluate performance against a baseline and show incremental improvements.

### Definition
Consistently follow established workflows — refine before developing, solution before building, review before merging, test before closing. Demonstrate measurable improvement in throughput, quality, and estimation accuracy over time.

### Observable Behaviors
- **Process compliance** — workflow tags present (Groomed, Solutioned, QA-Ready) before state transitions
- **Estimation discipline** — story points assigned, completed work tracked, estimates vs. actuals improving
- **Quality gates** — PR reviews requested and addressed, test coverage maintained or improved
- **Acceptance criteria** — filled in before development begins, verified at closeout
- **Cycle time** — stories moving through workflow states at a healthy pace

### Evidence Mapping
| Activity Data | Signal Strength |
|---------------|----------------|
| All workflow tags present in correct order before state transitions | Strong |
| Story points assigned and completed/remaining work tracked | Strong |
| PR reviews requested, feedback addressed before merge | Strong |
| Acceptance criteria present before dev starts | Some |
| Test coverage stable or improving across the period | Some |
| Missing tags, no estimation, no PR reviews, items jumping states | None observed |

### Metrics
- Stories refined, solutioned, and/or developed (count)
- Average cycle time per task (days)
- Quality ratio: items resolved without rework vs. items bounced back

## Self-Motivation

Self-Motivation empowers you to define your path and own the vision to accomplish the goals you set. It is important to your personal brand and career.
