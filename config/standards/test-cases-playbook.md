# Salesforce Test Cases Playbook (Dev + QA/UAT)

This playbook defines the methodology for creating high-quality, unambiguous, and traceable test cases for Salesforce enhancements. It is referenced by Phase 03d (Test Cases) and drives the quality bar for all generated test artifacts.

---

## §1 Testing Strategy

Before writing individual test cases, define the testing strategy for the work item.

### Test Objectives
What the test suite proves — derived from acceptance criteria + solution components:
- **Functional correctness** — each AC works as designed under normal conditions
- **Data integrity** — CRUD operations produce correct field values, relationships, and record states
- **Performance** — solution operates within governor limits and meets responsiveness expectations
- **Security** — access controls, data isolation, and sharing rules enforce correctly

### Scope Definition
- **In-scope**: features, modules, and integrations directly touched by this work item
- **Out-of-scope**: existing functionality not modified; upstream/downstream systems not changed
- Derive from `solution_design.components` and `integration_points`

### Suite Organization
Classify each planned test into one or more buckets:
- **Smoke**: post-deployment sanity — "is the org healthy?"
- **Regression**: existing behavior not broken by changes
- **Feature**: new or modified functionality validation
- **UAT**: business stakeholder verification using real workflows

### Entry Points
Identify which channels each test targets:
- Lightning UI (standard Salesforce experience)
- Experience Cloud (community/portal users)
- Mobile (Salesforce Mobile App)
- API (REST/SOAP/Bulk/Streaming)
- Integration User (system-to-system, platform events, scheduled jobs)

## §2 Test Types

Not all types apply to every work item. Flag each as **Applicable** or **N/A** with justification.

| # | Type | Owner | When It Applies | What to Generate |
|---|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Unit testing** | Dev | Apex code changes (classes, triggers, actions) | Apex unit test patterns with System.assert, Test.startTest/stopTest, mock callouts |
| 2 | **Smoke testing** | QA | Any change to core flows | High-level checks: login, navigation, create/edit key records |
| 3 | **Integration testing** | QA | System boundary changes (API, events, external callouts) | Data flow validation across boundaries, error handling, retry logic |
| 4 | **System testing** | QA | End-to-end journeys affected | Full journey from entry to completion across Salesforce objects |
| 5 | **UAT** | Business | User-facing changes | Business-language scripts with observable outcomes |
| 6 | **Performance testing** | QA/Dev | Bulk operations, governor limits, complex queries | Bulk data scenarios (1, 2, 200 records), SOQL query performance |
| 7 | **Security testing** | QA/Dev | Permission/sharing changes, new objects/fields | CRUD/FLS per persona, sharing rule enforcement, profile-based access |

---

## §3 Test Data Matrix

### Purpose
Define reusable test data rows that test cases reference by ID (D1, D2, etc.). This ensures consistency and repeatability across test execution.

### Row Structure
Each row defines a complete test context:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Row ID** | D1, D2, D3... with emoji prefix: 👤 persona, 📊 data variation, ⚠️ negative/edge |
| **Persona** | Profile name, permission sets, role in hierarchy, license type |
| **Record context** | Record type, key field values, parent/child relationships |
| **Feature flags** | Custom settings, custom metadata types, feature toggles |
| **Boundary values** | Min/max, null/blank, long strings (255+ chars), special characters |
| **External IDs** | For integration/identity resolution scenarios |
| **Error injection** | Downstream failures, timeouts, missing data (for resilience tests) |

### Persona Detail
For each persona row (👤), document:
1. **Test user setup**: username, profile, permission sets, role
2. **Required test records**: object, record name, key field values, purpose
3. **Feature flag configuration**: flag name, value, reason

---

## §4 AC-Centric Coverage

Every test case traces to one or more acceptance criteria. The coverage model ensures no AC is left untested.

### Coverage Status
- ✅ **Full** — has at least one happy path AND one unhappy path test
- ⚠️ **Partial** — has only happy OR only unhappy path tests (requires written justification)
- ❌ **Gap** — no test coverage (blocker — must be addressed before saving)

### Minimum Requirements
- Every AC MUST have at least ONE happy path test (path A)
- Every AC MUST have at least ONE unhappy path test (path B, C, D, E, or F)
- P1 test cases should cover both happy and critical negatives for each AC

---

## §5 Six-Path Coverage Model

Generate test cases per AC using six coverage paths. Not every path applies to every AC — generate only where relevant.

### A) Happy Path
The simplest successful scenario. Validates the AC works as designed with valid inputs, correct permissions, and expected data.

**Generate when**: Always — every AC gets at least one happy path test.

### B) Negative Path
Validates error handling when things go wrong: validation rules fire, required fields missing, duplicate rules trigger, permissions denied.

**Generate when**: Always — every AC gets at least one negative test.

**Salesforce-specific scenarios**:
- Validation rule fires → user-friendly error message displayed
- Required field missing → save blocked with field-level error
- Duplicate rule → merge/block behavior as configured
- Insufficient permissions → access denied, no data leak

### C) Edge Cases
Boundary conditions and unusual-but-valid inputs.

**Generate when**: Data input, bulk operations, picklist dependencies, record types, dynamic forms.

**Salesforce-specific scenarios**:
- Null/blank values in optional fields
- Maximum field lengths (255 char text, 131072 char long text)
- Picklist values not in expected set (mismatched record types)
- Time zone edge cases (cross-day boundaries)
- Bulk operations: 1 record, 2 records, 200 records (trigger batch boundary)
- Mixed record types in same batch
- Dynamic forms — field visibility conditions

### D) Security
Access control and data isolation verification.

**Generate when**: New objects, new fields, sharing rule changes, profile/permission set modifications.

**Salesforce-specific scenarios**:
- CRUD per persona: can create? read? update? delete?
- FLS per persona: can see field? edit field?
- Sharing: record owner access, role hierarchy access, manual shares, sharing rules
- Data isolation: User A cannot see User B's records when sharing restricts
- Running user context in automation (flows, triggers, Apex)

### E) Automation Behavior
Validates that automated processes behave correctly, especially order-of-execution concerns.

**Generate when**: Triggers, flows, validation rules, process builders, platform events modified.

**Salesforce-specific scenarios**:
- Order of execution: validation rules → before triggers → after triggers → flows
- Recursion guards: trigger fires, updates record, trigger fires again — handled?
- Idempotency: same input twice produces same result (no double-creation)
- Mixed DML: setup objects (User, PermissionSet) + non-setup in same transaction
- Governor limits: SOQL queries, DML statements, CPU time under bulk

### F) Integration + Async
External system interactions and asynchronous processing.

**Generate when**: External callouts, platform events, queueable/batch/scheduled Apex, CDC.

**Salesforce-specific scenarios**:
- External system down → error logged, retry queued, user notified
- External system slow → timeout handled gracefully
- Platform event published → subscriber receives and processes
- Retry logic → failed events reprocessed successfully
- Eventual consistency → async process completes within expected window
- Error logging → integration errors captured in custom log object or Nebula Logger

## §6 UAT Scripts

UAT scripts are business-friendly test scripts for stakeholder validation. They differ from QA test cases:

| Aspect | QA Test Case | UAT Script |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Audience** | Technical testers | Business stakeholders |
| **Language** | Technical (SOQL, API, field names) | Business (natural language, workflow terms) |
| **Scope** | Specific paths and edge cases | End-to-end business workflows |
| **Expected results** | Exact field values, record states | Observable business outcomes |
| **Pass/fail** | Precise assertions | Business acceptance decision |

### UAT Script Structure
Each UAT script includes:
1. **Title** — business-language description of what's being validated
2. **Persona** — which business role executes this script
3. **Preconditions** — what must exist before starting (in business terms)
4. **Steps** — clear actions using business terminology, not technical jargon
5. **Expected results** — what the user should observe at each step
6. **Data requirements** — what records/users must exist
7. **Acceptance criteria** — explicit pass/fail decision for the script

---

## §7 Test Case Quality — Unambiguous & Provable

Every test case must be **unambiguous** (anyone can execute it) and **provable** (pass/fail is objective).

### Measurable Expected Results
❌ Bad: "Record is routed correctly"
✅ Good: "Record Owner = 'Enrollment Queue'; Priority = 'Medium'; Status = 'New'"

❌ Bad: "Error message displays"
✅ Good: "Toast message shows: 'You do not have permission to edit this record.' with severity 'error'"

❌ Bad: "Data syncs properly"
✅ Good: "Contact.External_ID__c = '12345'; Contact.Sync_Status__c = 'Synced'; Contact.Last_Sync__c = TODAY"

### Deterministic Steps
- One action per step
- Numbered sequentially
- No branching ("if X, then Y" — split into separate test cases)
- Exact inputs specified (not "enter some data" — "enter 'John Smith' in First Name")

### Pass/Fail Criteria
Every test case explicitly states:
- What constitutes a **pass** (all expected results match)
- What constitutes a **fail** (any deviation from expected results)
- What to do on fail (log defect, capture screenshot, note actual vs. expected)

---

## §8 Smoke Test Pack

The smoke test pack is a minimum post-deployment verification checklist. It answers: "Is the org healthy after deployment?"

### Standard Smoke Checks
| # | Check | What to Verify | Pass Criteria |
|---|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Login + navigation** | Core app loads, affected tabs/pages accessible | No errors, pages render, menus work |
| 2 | **Create key record** | Create/update records affected by the change | Record saves, fields populate, no errors |
| 3 | **Automation sanity** | Routing, assignment, approval rules fire | Expected automation triggers, correct outcomes |
| 4 | **Integration handshake** | External system queues, logging, event delivery | No errors in logs, events published/received |
| 5 | **Report/dashboard** | Representative report loads (if applicable) | Data displays, no timeouts, correct counts |

### Smoke Pack Principles
- **Shallow, not deep** — confirms basic health, not full coverage
- **Fast** — entire pack should complete in <15 minutes
- **Independent** — each check can run in any order
- **Repeatable** — same results on repeated execution

---

## §9 Test Data Repeatability

### Data Recipes
Every test data row should include a "recipe" — a repeatable setup procedure:
1. **User creation**: profile assignment, permission sets, role
2. **Record creation**: object, field values, relationships
3. **Configuration**: feature flags, custom settings, sharing rules
4. **Cleanup**: what to delete/reset after test execution

### Avoid
- "Create a contact" — which fields? what values?
- "Use an admin user" — which profile? which permission sets?
- "Enable the feature" — which setting? what value? where?

### Prefer
- "Create Contact: FirstName='Test', LastName='User_D1', Email='test.d1@sandbox.test', RecordType='Student'"
- "User: Profile='Admissions User', PermSets=['Email_Composer_User'], Role='Admissions_Advisor'"
- "CustomSetting Feature_Flags__c: Enable_New_UI__c = true"

---

## §10 Developer & QA Validation

### Developer Validation (per test case)
Each test case includes guidance for the developer writing unit tests:

1. **Unit test pattern** — Apex test method skeleton with Arrange/Act/Assert
2. **Assertions to implement** — specific `System.assertEquals` / `System.assertNotEquals` calls
3. **Mocks required** — `HttpCalloutMock`, `Test.setMock`, custom mocks for external services
4. **Integration points to verify** — trigger execution (check debug log), flow execution, platform event publication

### QA Validation (per test case)
Each test case includes guidance for the QA tester:

1. **Step-by-step navigation** — App Launcher → Tab → Action
2. **Data verification query** — SOQL to confirm record state post-test
3. **Visual verification checkpoints** — specific UI elements to check
4. **Environment prerequisites** — user login, feature flags, permission sets

## §11 Quality Traps to Avoid

These are common test case quality failures. Phase 03d quality gates check for all of them.

| # | Trap | Symptom | Fix |
|---|------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **Admin-only testing** | All tests run as System Administrator | Add persona-specific test cases for each relevant profile |
| 2 | **Vague expected results** | "Works correctly", "Displays properly", "Saves successfully" | Rewrite with exact field values, record states, UI text |
| 3 | **Implicit test data** | "Create a record", "Use a test user" | Specify exact field values, profile, permission sets |
| 4 | **Missing negative tests** | Only happy paths tested | Add validation rule, permission denial, missing data scenarios |
| 5 | **Mega-tests** | Single test covers 5+ ACs | Split into focused tests covering ≤3 ACs each |
| 6 | **Untraceable tests** | Test doesn't map to any AC | Add AC mapping or remove test if not needed |
| 7 | **Non-deterministic steps** | "If X, do Y; otherwise do Z" | Split into separate test cases for each branch |
| 8 | **Missing cleanup** | Test leaves orphaned data | Add post-conditions/cleanup steps |
| 9 | **Copy-paste tests** | Identical steps with minor variations | Use data matrix rows to parameterize |
| 10 | **No telemetry** | No way to verify backend behavior | Add debug log patterns, event monitoring, custom log checks |
