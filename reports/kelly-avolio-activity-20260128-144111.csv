There are more than one IP Address log record for a given fuzzy match IP address (For eg applications from IPs 250.250.250.1 and&nbsp;250.250.250.2 are supposed to be linked to the same IP address log record. Instead It has two more records).&nbsp;In the example you shared, there are two fuzzy matching records (IP01547 | EApp Guest User Ip Address Log | Salesforce,&nbsp;IP22868 | EApp Guest User Ip Address Log | Salesforce)&nbsp;the applicaiton was marked as SPAM because one of the IP address log record is flagged as SPAM)Fix:Fortunately, duplicate fuzzy IPs are not being created any more. The last duplicate fuzzy IP record was created only on 12/17. So, there is no code fix needed.We only need to fix the data by getting rid of duplicate fuzzy IP records and reparent applications as needed. Amit is currently working on the list. We will share it with your for review soon.&nbsp;@Omololu Osazuwa&nbsp;@Denise Dyer&nbsp;@Kelly Avolio",Prakash Sriram

However, this section is rendered through a separate LWC, which we cannot modify. Since it was already mentioned that this can be ignored if compliance allows, I believe we can proceed without addressing this item.Regarding the Campus field, the business has requested that it be either:A picklist, orAuto-populated based on Duty StationCurrently:The Campus field is required on the record page.Leads may be created without a Duty Station, which makes enforcing Campus as required problematic.We already have backend automation that updates the Campus field when Duty Station changes (update scenario only).Regarding changing the Campus field to a picklist:This field is heavily used across integrations and multiple code references.Changing its data type would introduce significant risk and could break existing functionality.Therefore, converting the existing Campus field to a picklist would be a major and unsafe change.Proposed Solution:Create a new picklist field (e.g., Campus Selection).Replace the original Campus field with this new picklist on the page layout/ record page and make it required.Implement automation so that when a value is selected in the new picklist, it populates the original Campus field.Continue to use the original Campus field for integrations and backend logic, ensuring no downstream impact.Please let me know your thoughts on this approach",Asha Shaik

I wanted to share a final clarification on the scope and expectations of the SOP, incorporating our latest alignment.The SOP will begin with the Solution — not Intake.Existing intake paths (CRM Request Form, internal ADO ticket creation, Fast Track triage) remain unchanged and are out of scope for this document.Where the SOP startsThe SOP applies once an Admin or Developer has identified that the solution involves:Installing a Salesforce Installed Package (managed or unmanaged), orImplementing a 3rd-party integration.From that point forward, the SOP should define what is required to successfully prepare the solution&nbsp;for:Solution Review (Architect and/or Senior Resource)Security and Compliance ReviewRelease Management executionWhat the Solution must includeIn addition to technical and architectural details, the Solution must clearly document:Step-by-step implementation approachRequired pre-deployment tasks&nbsp;(environment readiness, prerequisites, permissions, setup)Required post-deployment tasks&nbsp;(validation, monitoring, reconciliation, rollback considerations)Sandbox testing strategy and scenariosSecurity and compliance considerationsThe goal is to ensure that Solution Reviews are efficient and that Release Managers receive work that is fully vetted, implementation-ready, and clearly documented.Next StepsPlease review the draft SOP and help me fully define the Solution and Solution Review sections. Also help me define Task Templates and/or User Story Templates that I can add on to this documentation.​[SOP-001] Installed Packages &amp; 3rd Party Integrations - Salesforce.docx​​[SOP-001-APP-A] ADO Task Template -- 2a - [Solution] - Complete - XXXXXX​​[SOP-001-APP-B] ADO Task Template --&nbsp;2b - [Solution] - Review - XXXXXX​​[SOP-001-APP-C] ADO Task Template --&nbsp;XX - [Security and Compliance] - Review - XXXXXX.docx​​[SOP-001-APP-D] ADO Task Template --&nbsp;XX - [Release Management] - Delivery - XXXXXX.docx​For a summary the call yesterday, you can view in more detail within the comment section of User Story 250519.I will schedule a follow-up meeting to review/finalize the SOP related the Solution / Solution Review section.Thank you again for your assistance and collaboration,Michael Watts",Michael Watts

Is there an update to this ticket? With sometimes hundreds of webinar registrants per month, we're starting to see a growing data deficit that is inhibiting our lead outreach processes. As a quick TLDR, the webinar registration form collects all of this, but only first/last name and email are forwarded to SF.I asked the webinar owners to download the registrant reports in the meantime so I can manually add Duty Station, and the reports are not printing the custom fields (see example report). I escalated to Europe IT to ensure it wasn't a permissions issue, and they, too, couldn't pull down the custom field input.

They won't lock the system unless we don't pay for an extended period of time, which is not a concern here.There is usually a window they allow for companies to fix the overages before they attempt to charge and we are at 98% as of today.It is important that we remove outdated / unused data as quickly as possible, but don't feel overly rushed.&nbsp;",Michael Watts

I am concerned that this could result in frequent student reassignments every time someone leaves or changes roles, especially since our groups are large. Such changes could negatively impact the students' experience. I understand that this might work better in smaller groups or specific duty stations. However, I think we need to explore this in more detail with the business. Once the rationale is established, could we include an option to select which groups use the balancing functionality? Perhaps we could implement this feature with a checkbox or a similar tool.Thoughts?&nbsp;@Jen Matos",Hana Milazzo

For example, many departments have multiple roles that work different queues - as one example, the Admissions Services department has the main Admissions Services team and the Residency team, so based on the role the Residency cases would need to route to the Residency queue instead.&nbsp;As a result, all we need to reference in the flow is the Case Owner User's UMGC Department and User Role fields, so no new Department values are needed.&nbsp;(Also, as an additional piece of this, the queues listed on Department are Action queues for Omni-Channel, not Case queues, so if we did want to use the Department object for this we would also need to add Case queue values for the existing Departments.)&nbsp;So as a result, all we need to do here is define a desired queue for case escalation for System Administrators.",Samuel Anderson

Creating a user account specifically for the cloud connector ensures better visibility and security.To create a Salesforce user:Log in to the Salesforce console as an administrator.Navigate to&nbsp;Setup&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Administration&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Users&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Users.Click&nbsp;New User.Specify a user name and enter other details. Ensure that you assign a role, profile, and user license to the new user. You can assign any role to the user. The user license must match the license assigned to a user profile that you selected for the new user. For more information, see&nbsp;Add a New user.To obtain a user password, select the&nbsp;Generate new password and notify user immediately&nbsp;checkbox.Click&nbsp;Save.The&nbsp;User Details&nbsp;page displays the details you entered. Note the password that Salesforce emailed you. If you want to reset the password, on the&nbsp;User Details&nbsp;page, click&nbsp;Reset Password. Salesforce sends an email to the user’s email address with a link to reset the password. Reset the password using the link that you received on your email address. Note the username and password of the Salesforce user that you created. You will need the username and password when you configure the Salesforce Cloud Connector on the Exabeam Cloud Connectors platform.&nbsp;Obtain an API TokenSalesforce APIs are authenticated through API token, also known as security token. The Exabeam Cloud Connectors platform uses an API token to integrate with Salesforce cloud application APIs, and retrieve audit log events, changes, and other data. The cloud connector uses audit logs and other data for security monitoring to analyze and handle security threats.To obtain the Salesforce API token:Log in to the Salesforce console using the user name and password of the user that you created.Click the profile image in the upper right corner, then click&nbsp;Settings.In the right pane, navigate to&nbsp;My Personal Information&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Reset My Security Token.Click&nbsp;Reset Security Token&nbsp;to have Salesforce generate a new security token and send it to you via email.Record the security token, represented by letters and numbers, that you receive via email. Use the security token while configuring the Salesforce Cloud Connector on the Exabeam Cloud Connectors platform.via:&nbsp;https://docs.exabeam.com/en/cloud-connectors/all/configuration/132990-salesforce-cloud-connector.htmlSharing this as a step that will need to be done.&nbsp;@Kelly Avolio, from a timing standpoint, when would this work be anticipated to be started? Just so I can align resources on my side.&nbsp;",Randel Sankar

We now need to create an additional validation rule for Duty Station, applicable only to users in Europe and Asia. Additionally, there are requests for changes on the New Lead creation page due to duplicate sections. This duplication is occurring because there are two “Details” sections on the Global_Standard_Lead_DualView_Lightning_Page. To resolve this, we have two options: Hide the tabbed view, or Hide the Details tab entirely, to eliminate the duplicated sections. There is also a request to hide non-editable sections, specifically Activity Metrics, which should either be: Removed completely from the Lightning Record Page, or Hidden for specific profiles. Otherwise, we would need to implement a Screen Flow and override the New button to control the Lead creation experience.
