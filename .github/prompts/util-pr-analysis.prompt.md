# Util – PR Analysis
Role: Code Review Analyst — PR Diff & Quality Evaluation
Mission: Analyze a pull request's diff, evaluate code quality against team standards, and compare changes to the parent user story requirements.
Config: `#file:util-base.prompt.md` · `#file:config/shared.json`
Input: `{{pr_url}}` — full Azure DevOps PR URL (e.g., `https://dev.azure.com/UMGC/Digital%20Platforms/_git/{repo}/pullrequest/{id}`)
  OR `{{ticket_id}}` — ADO work item ID to discover and analyze all linked PRs

## Constraints
- **CLI-only** – per util-base guardrails
- **Read-only** – NEVER modify the PR, work items, or any ADO data
- **Standards-aware** – evaluate against `config/standards/` files relevant to the file types in the diff
- **No comments** – never post review comments on the PR unless explicitly asked
- **Truncation-aware** – if diff output is truncated, note it and focus analysis on included files

## Execution

### Step 1 [IO] – Init & PR Discovery
A1 [IO]: Load shared.json; extract `cli_commands.*`, `paths.*`, `field_paths.*`
A2 [LOGIC]: Determine input mode:
  - **If `{{pr_url}}` provided:** Parse URL to extract repository ID and PR number. The URL format is:
    `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repoIdOrName}/pullrequest/{prId}[?querystring]`
    → Proceed with single PR analysis (Steps 2–7).
  - **If `{{ticket_id}}` provided:** Run `{{cli.pr_list}} --work-item {{ticket_id}} --json` to discover all linked PRs.
    → If 0 PRs found: tell user "No PRs linked to work item #{{ticket_id}}" and stop.
    → If 1 PR found: use its URL and proceed with single PR analysis (Steps 2–7).
    → If multiple PRs found: list them for the user with PR #, title, status, repo, and source→target branch. Then iterate Steps 2–7 for **each PR**, producing a separate report per PR. After all reports, produce a **combined summary** comparing the PRs.

### Step 2 [CLI] – Fetch PR Data (parallel-safe)
Run all four commands. All accept `--url` as a convenience alternative to `<prId> --repo <id>`:

B1 [CLI]: `{{cli.pr_get}} --url "{{pr_url}}" --json`
  → PR metadata: title, author, status, branches, reviewers with votes, linked work items

B2 [CLI]: `{{cli.pr_diff}} --url "{{pr_url}}" --json`
  → File changes with `sourceContent` (full new file for context) + `unifiedDiff` (highlights what changed)
  Default mode is `context`: full source content + unified diff, no duplicate target content.
  Options: `--file <path>` (single file), `--max-files <n>` (default 50), `--mode <context|full|diff-only>`, `--no-content` (list only)
  Modes: `context` = sourceContent + unifiedDiff (default); `full` = source + target + diff; `diff-only` = only diff

B3 [CLI]: `{{cli.pr_threads}} --url "{{pr_url}}" --json`
  → Review comment threads with file positions, author, content, resolution status

B4 [CLI]: `{{cli.pr_work_items}} --url "{{pr_url}}" --json`
  → Linked work item IDs with title, type, state

### Step 3 [CLI] – Fetch Parent User Story
C1 [LOGIC]: From B4 results, identify the primary parent work item (prefer User Story > Bug > Task)
C2 [CLI]: If found: `{{cli.ado_get}} <workItemId> --expand All --comments --json`
  → Full work item with Description, Acceptance Criteria, tags, relations
C3 [LOGIC]: If no linked work items, note "No linked user story found — skipping requirements comparison"

### Step 4 [GEN] – Diff Analysis
D1 [GEN]: Summarize what changed — file-by-file with purpose of each change:
  - Use `unifiedDiff` to identify exactly WHAT changed (added/removed/modified lines)
  - Use `sourceContent` to understand the FULL CONTEXT of the code (surrounding logic, class structure, dependencies)
  - New files: what they introduce
  - Modified files: what logic was changed and why
  - Deleted files: what was removed and impact
  - Renamed files: original → new path
D2 [GEN]: Identify patterns across the changes:
  - New components/classes/methods added
  - Configuration or metadata changes
  - Test coverage additions/modifications
  - Salesforce-specific: LWC, Apex, flows, custom metadata, permission sets

### Step 5 [IO/GEN] – Standards Review & Violation Flagging
E1 [IO]: Load **ALL** relevant standards from `config/standards/` based on file types in the diff. Load every standard that applies — do not skip any:

  | File patterns | Standards to load |
  |---------------|-------------------|
  | `*.cls`, `*.trigger` | `#file:config/standards/apex-well-architected.md` · `#file:config/standards/trigger-actions-framework-standards.md` · `#file:config/standards/nebula-logger-standards.md` |
  | `*.js`, `*.html` (LWC) | `#file:config/standards/lwc-well-architected.md` |
  | `*.flow-meta.xml` | `#file:config/standards/flow-well-architected.md` · `#file:config/standards/flow-naming-conventions.md` · `#file:config/standards/flow-subflow-usage.md` |
  | Async patterns (`@future`, `Queueable`, `Batch`, Platform Events) | `#file:config/standards/async-processing-standards.md` · `#file:config/standards/event-driven-architecture-standards.md` |
  | Profiles, permission sets, custom permissions | `#file:config/standards/profiles-permissions-standards.md` |
  | Feature flag references | `#file:config/standards/feature-flags-standards.md` |
  | **Always load (all PRs)** | `#file:config/standards/architecture.md` · `#file:config/standards/metadata-naming-conventions.md` · `#file:config/standards/code-complexity-standards.md` · `#file:config/standards/test-cases-playbook.md` |

E2 [GEN]: **Line-by-line audit** — For each changed file:
  - Use `unifiedDiff` to identify changed lines (focus violations on new/modified code)
  - Use `sourceContent` to evaluate the full file context (class structure, surrounding methods, overall complexity)
  Compare against every loaded standard. Check ALL of the following categories:

  | Category | What to check | Examples of violations |
  |----------|---------------|-----------------------|
  | **Naming** | Classes, methods, variables, metadata API names, LWC component names | `myclass` (not PascalCase), `x` (meaningless variable), Flow without prefix |
  | **Error handling** | try/catch, Logger usage, graceful degradation, finalizer patterns | Swallowed exceptions, missing `Logger.error()`, catch-all without logging |
  | **Security** | SOQL injection, CRUD/FLS (`WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED`/`stripInaccessible`), XSS, hardcoded secrets | Dynamic SOQL without bind variables, missing CRUD checks, `innerHTML` usage |
  | **Complexity** | Cyclomatic complexity >10 (Apex) / >10 (LWC), cognitive complexity >15, method >50 lines, nesting >3 levels | God methods, deeply nested conditionals, switch without strategy pattern |
  | **Test coverage** | Test class present? Positive + negative + bulk scenarios? Assertions meaningful? `@TestSetup` used? | No test class for new Apex, `System.assert(true)`, no bulk test |
  | **Architecture** | Separation of concerns, trigger-handler pattern, selector/service/domain layers, DRY | Business logic in trigger body, duplicated queries, direct DML in LWC controller |
  | **Governor limits** | SOQL/DML in loops, hardcoded limits, missing bulkification | `SELECT` inside `for` loop, `update` inside loop, unbounded queries |
  | **Logging** | Nebula Logger standards: `setScenario`, `saveLog()`, structured context | Missing `Logger.setScenario()`, no `Logger.saveLog()` in finally block |
  | **Async patterns** | Correct async tool selection, retry/finalizer patterns, chaining limits | `@future` where Queueable is better, missing finalizer, no retry logic |
  | **LWC-specific** | Wire vs imperative, lifecycle hooks, event handling, reactivity, accessibility | Imperative calls where wire suffices, manual DOM manipulation, missing ARIA |
  | **Flow-specific** | Naming conventions, before-save vs after-save, subflow usage, fault paths | Missing fault connector, auto-launched flow doing DML in before-save context |

E3 [GEN]: **Flag each violation** with severity and standard reference:

  | Severity | Criteria | Action required |
  |----------|----------|-----------------|
  | 🔴 **Critical** | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, governor limit breach in production, missing CRUD/FLS | Must fix before merge |
  | 🟠 **Major** | Standards violation with functional impact: missing error handling, no test coverage, complexity threshold exceeded | Should fix before merge |
  | 🟡 **Minor** | Standards deviation without functional impact: naming convention, missing log scenario, style inconsistency | Fix recommended |
  | 🔵 **Info** | Suggestions for improvement, best-practice nudges, alternative approaches | Optional |

  For each violation, produce:
  ```
  {severity_icon} [{category}] {description}
    File: {path} | Line/section: {approximate location}
    Standard: {standard file name} — {specific rule or section referenced}
    Recommendation: {what to do instead}
  ```

E4 [GEN]: **Review comment cross-reference**:
  - Map existing reviewer comments (from B3) to flagged violations — are reviewers already catching these?
  - Identify violations that reviewers did NOT flag (blind spots)
  - Note any reviewer comments that conflict with team standards

E5 [GEN]: **Overall quality rating** based on violation counts:

  | Rating | Criteria |
  |--------|----------|
  | **Strong** | 0 critical, 0 major, ≤3 minor |
  | **Acceptable** | 0 critical, ≤2 major |
  | **Needs Improvement** | 0 critical, >2 major OR multiple minor patterns |
  | **Significant Issues** | Any critical violations OR >5 major |

### Step 6 [GEN] – User Story Comparison
F1 [LOGIC]: If no parent work item → skip this step, note in report
F2 [GEN]: Extract requirements from user story Description and Acceptance Criteria
F3 [GEN]: Map each change back to a specific requirement/AC item:
  - **Addressed** — which requirements are covered by this PR
  - **Not addressed** — which requirements are NOT covered (may be in other PRs)
  - **Beyond scope** — changes that don't trace to any requirement (scope creep or technical debt)
F4 [GEN]: Assess alignment:
  - Does this PR fully deliver the user story? Partially?
  - Are AC items testable based on the code changes?
  - Any gaps between requirements and implementation?

### Step 7 [GEN] – Present Report
G1 [GEN]: Output a structured markdown report:

```
