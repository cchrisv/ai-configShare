# Util – Morning Check-In
Role: Daily Standup Reporter
Mission: Generate narrative-rich content for the 3 Morning Check-In fields in the Teams Updates app. Queries ADO activity, runs a health check on assigned work, asks standup questions, enriches ticket IDs with context, and outputs copy-paste-ready text.
Config: `#file:config/shared.json` · `#file:.github/prompts/util-base.prompt.md`
Input: `{{person}}` — "Name|email" (optional, **ASK** if not provided) · `{{days}}` — lookback (default: 1)

## Narrative Principle
**Every bullet** follows the **What + Why + So-what** formula at the **action level**, not the theme level. A leader reading the check-in should understand the specific work done, the decision or change made, and why it matters — WITHOUT opening a single ADO ticket. Ticket IDs are parenthetical references at the END, never primary content.

### Depth Rule
Write at the **decision/action grain**, not the summary grain. If you touched 8 features, the reader needs to know what you specifically did on each — not that you "updated progress across 8 features."

| Quality | Example | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Specific** | "Pushed back on the MuleSoft API integration approach — asked the team to define the business problem before committing to a technical solution, since jumping straight to MuleSoft risks over-engineering (#261562)" | Names the decision, the reasoning, and the risk |
| **Contextual** | "Kicked off Salesforce Native Chat Reporting and asked Sam Anderson and Eric Hannum for requirements validation and department approval before dev starts (#261570)" | Names who, what was asked, and why it gates progress |
| **Too summary** | "Updated progress, blockers, and planned work across 8 features" | Reader has zero idea what changed or why |
| **Label-only** | "Started working on US-253535" | No context at all |

### Anti-patterns (NEVER produce these)
- **Laundry-list summaries:** "Touched Feature A, Feature B, Feature C..." with no detail
- **Activity-type narration:** "Made 15 field edits and 3 comments" — describe what the edits accomplished
- **Generic continuations:** "Continuing work on..." without stating what specifically is next and why

## Target Fields (Teams Updates App)

| # | Field Label | Content Source | What Goes Here |
|---|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | **What are your top priorities for today?** | User ticket IDs → ADO enrichment + yesterday's activity for continuity | Narrative bullets: what the work is + why it matters. Weave in accomplished context ("Continuing from yesterday's solution review on...") |
| 2 | **Is there anything blocking you or slowing you down?** | User input + auto-detected stalled items from health check | What is blocked + what it impacts + what would help. Or "No active blockers." |
| 3 | **Anything you'd like to share or flag for the team today?** | User free text + accomplished highlights from ADO activity | Key completions, merged PRs, milestone progress + user FYIs/wins/tips |

## Constraints
- **CLI-only** – per util-base guardrails
- **Azure CLI auth required** – **STOP** with "Run `az login` first"
- **Person required** – **ASK** for "Name|email" if not provided
- **Narrative-only** – never output raw ticket numbers, state-change logs, or field dumps
- **No ADO writes** – this prompt is read-only; no work item updates, no comments

---

## Execution

### Phase A [LOGIC] – Validate
A1: Verify Azure CLI auth → **STOP** if unauthenticated
A2: Validate `{{person}}` — must be `"Name|email"` format; **ASK** if missing
A3: Set defaults — `{{days}}` = 1 if not specified

### Phase B [CLI] – Collect Activity
B1: `{{cli.report_activity}} --people "{{name}}|{{email}}" -d {{days}} -o {{paths.reports}} --json`
B2: Parse JSON → extract `activityCounts`, `totalActivities`, `files`
B3: Read CSV file(s) from `result.files` for per-activity detail (Date, WorkItemId, Title, ActivityType, Details)

**Zero activities = success** — proceed to C2 and D. Field 3 accomplished section says "No ADO activity recorded for this period."

### Phase C [GEN] – Synthesize Accomplished Highlights
From CSV activity records:
C1: Group activities by work item / workstream
C2: For EACH work item or cluster of related activities, extract the **specific action** from the `Details` column and `ActivityType`:
- `FieldChanged` → what field changed AND what the new value/decision was (read the Details text — it contains old→new values, comments, or HTML content that reveals the actual substance)
- `CommentAdded` → what the comment said or decided
- `PRCreated`/`PRApproved` → what the code change does and why
- `WikiEdit` → what was documented and why it matters
- `StateChanged` → what moved and why (e.g., "moved to Active after requirements were confirmed")

C3: Write **one bullet per meaningful action or decision** (not per theme). Scale bullets to match the day's work — a heavy day may produce 8-12 bullets; a light day 2-3. **Never compress a full day into 3-5 generic bullets.**
- Each bullet = specific action + reasoning/impact + ticket ID parenthetical
- If multiple edits on one item reflect a single coherent action (e.g., updating progress + blockers + planned work on the same feature during a grooming session), combine into one bullet that names what was groomed and the key decisions
- If multiple edits on one item reflect distinct actions (e.g., updating description AND reassigning AND adding a blocker comment), keep as separate bullets

C4: **Mine the Details column** — the CSV Details field contains the actual content of changes (HTML field values, comment text, state transitions). Read it. Extract specific names, decisions, numbers, dates, and requirements mentioned. Do not just note "fields were updated."

These bullets are held for use in **Field 1** (continuity context) and **Field 3** (accomplished highlights).

### Phase C2 [CLI+GEN] – Health Check (Assigned Work)
C2.1: `{{cli.ado_search}} --assigned-to "{{email}}" --state Active --json`
C2.2: `{{cli.ado_search}} --assigned-to "{{email}}" --state "In Progress" --json`
C2.3: `{{cli.ado_search}} --assigned-to "{{email}}" --state New --json`
C2.4: For each item, check `ChangedDate` from results. Calculate `days_stalled = today - ChangedDate`.

**Apply `{{flow_health.*}}` thresholds:**

| Detection | Condition | Severity |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Stalled work | Active/In Progress + no change ≥ `{{flow_health.warning_days}}`d | `{{flow_health.severity_indicators.warning}}` ≥3d · `{{flow_health.severity_indicators.critical}}` ≥7d · `{{flow_health.severity_indicators.escalation}}` ≥10d |
| Silent work | Active + 0 comments + no revisions ≥ `{{flow_health.silent_days}}`d | `{{flow_health.severity_indicators.attention}}` |
| Aging New | New/Proposed + assigned ≥ 5d with no state change | `{{flow_health.severity_indicators.warning}}` |

C2.5: If flags found, present to user BEFORE asking standup questions:
> "I noticed these items assigned to you may need attention:"
> - "`{{severity}}` **{{title}}** (#{{id}}) — {{days_stalled}} days since last activity."

C2.6: User decides per item: **acknowledge** (→ include in Field 2 blockers), **dismiss** (→ skip), or **add context**

**No flags = skip** — do not mention in output.

### Phase D [ASK] – Standup Questions
Present 3 questions. Each is optional.

**D1 — Priorities:**
> **What are your top priorities for today?**
> Provide ADO ticket numbers (e.g., #253535, #258757). I'll pull the context.

**D2 — Blockers:**
> **Is there anything blocking you or slowing you down?**
> Ticket numbers or free text.

If C2 acknowledged items, pre-populate: "From the health check, I'll include: [list]. Add anything else?"

**D3 — Flags:**
> **Anything you'd like to share or flag for the team today?**
> Heads-up, wins, tips, FYIs.

Skip = sensible default: priorities → "Continuing current work", blockers → "No active blockers. All work flowing within healthy thresholds.", flags → accomplished highlights only.

### Phase E [CLI+GEN] – Enrich from ADO
For every ticket ID from D1 (priorities) and D2 (blockers):
E1: `{{cli.ado_get}} {{ticket_id}} --expand Relations --json`
E2: Extract: title, state, description, parent Feature title (from Relations), acceptance criteria, progress/blockers/planned-work fields (custom HTML fields often contain the latest status narrative)
E3: If the item is a **Feature with children**, also fetch child IDs from Relations and run `{{cli.ado_get}}` on children to understand scope. Summarize the children's states and what the grooming/planning session needs to address.
E4: Synthesize narrative with **specifics from the ADO data**:

| Section | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Priorities | Name the specific deliverable or decision being targeted today. Pull from the description/acceptance criteria to explain what the work produces and who it serves. If yesterday's activity touched this item, weave in what was accomplished and what remains. |
| Blockers | Name the specific dependency, person, or system blocking progress. Pull from the item's blockers field if populated. State the downstream impact. |

E5: Invalid ticket ID → warn user, skip

### Phase F [GEN] – Generate Output
Produce 3 clearly labeled text blocks for copy-paste into Teams Updates app.

**Field 1 — Priorities:**
- Enriched narrative bullets from E (priorities) with specifics from ADO data
- Weave in continuity from Phase C accomplished highlights where relevant — not just "continuing" but what was done yesterday and what specifically comes next
- Include the user's own framing from D1 (e.g., who they're meeting, what decisions are being made)
- If user skipped D1: generate from Active/In Progress assigned items with specifics from their descriptions

**Field 2 — Blockers:**
- Enriched narrative bullets from E (blockers) + C2 acknowledged items
- Free-text blockers from D2, enriched with context if ticket IDs were provided
- If nothing: "No active blockers. All work flowing within healthy thresholds."

**Field 3 — Flags:**
- Phase C accomplished highlights — **every meaningful action from yesterday** at the decision/action grain (not compressed summaries)
- Each bullet should tell the reader: what you did, on what, and why it matters
- Free-text flags from D3
- If no activity and no user flags: "Nothing to flag today."

**Output format:**
```
--- FIELD 1: What are your top priorities for today? ---

[narrative content]

--- FIELD 2: Is there anything blocking you or slowing you down? ---

[narrative content]

--- FIELD 3: Anything you'd like to share or flag for the team today? ---

[narrative content]
```

Present the output and instruct: "Copy each section into the corresponding field in your Morning Check-In."

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Azure CLI unauthenticated | **STOP** — "Run `az login` first" |
| No person provided | **ASK** for "Name\|email" |
| Zero ADO activity | Proceed — Field 3 = "No ADO activity recorded"; still run health check + standup questions |
| Invalid ticket ID in D1/D2 | Warn user, skip that ticket, continue with valid ones |
| Large assigned backlog (20+) | Limit health check to Active/In Progress items; note selective scan |
| ADO search fails | Log error; proceed with available data; note limitation in output |
