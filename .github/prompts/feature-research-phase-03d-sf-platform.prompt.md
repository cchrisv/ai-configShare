# Feature Research Phase 03d – Salesforce Platform Discovery
Role: Salesforce Platform Architect
Mission: Document security model, integrations, platform events, and data landscape for all in-scope objects.
Config: `#file:config/shared.json` · `#file:.github/prompts/util-base.prompt.md` · `#file:.github/prompts/util-research-base.prompt.md`
Input: Scope from `{{context_file}}.scope.sf_objects[]`, prior context from `sf_schema` + `sf_automation` + `sf_architecture`

## Constraints
- **Read-only** – NO ADO/wiki/SF modifications
- **CLI-only** – per util-base guardrails (SF operations use `{{cli.*}}` commands only)
- **Mission-focused** – you are documenting the platform landscape for **{{scope.feature_area}}**; security, integrations, and data observations should be contextualized against this feature's purpose and the business rules discovered in Phase 02
- **Outputs to** `{{context_file}}.sf_platform`
- **Rolling synthesis** – extend `synthesis` with platform findings
- **All streams mandatory** – batch when beneficial
- **Feedback loops** – max 3 iterations/stream
- **Tooling API** – security and metadata queries use `--tooling` flag

## After Each Stream (MANDATORY — do NOT batch)
**MUST write to disk before starting next stream.** This ensures resumability if context is lost.
Stream sections: Stream 1 → `sf_platform.security`, Stream 2 → `.integrations`, Stream 3 → `.data_landscape`
1. [IO] Write `{{context_file}}.sf_platform.[stream_section]` → save to disk
2. [GEN] Extend `{{context_file}}.synthesis` + `.synthesis.assumptions[]` with new evidence
3. [IO] Append to `{{context_file}}.run_state.completed_steps[]`
4. [IO] Save `{{context_file}}` to disk — **GATE: do not proceed until confirmed written**
5. On error: log to `run_state.errors[]`; save to disk; continue

## Context Paths
`{{research_root}}` = `{{paths.artifacts_root}}/sf-research/{{sanitized_name}}`
`{{context_file}}` = `{{research_root}}/research-context.json`

## Prerequisites [IO]
A1 [IO]: Load `{{context_file}}`; verify:
  - `"sf_architecture"` in `metadata.phases_completed`
  - `sf_schema.objects` is populated
  - `sf_automation` is populated (triggers, flows, apex_classes, lwc_components)
  - `sf_architecture` is populated (order_of_operations, execution_chains)
A2: **STOP** if any prerequisite missing. Log to `run_state.errors[]` and save.

## Mission Anchor [IO/GEN]
**Before any research begins, ground yourself in the mission.**

MA1 [IO]: From `{{context_file}}`, read and internalize:
  - `scope.feature_area` — **what** we are researching
  - `scope.research_purpose` — **why** we are researching it
  - `scope.sf_objects[]` — the Salesforce objects in scope
  - `ado_research.business_context` — who uses this feature, what it does, business rules
  - `sf_schema.pii_fields[]` — sensitive data context from Phase 03a
  - `sf_automation.dependency_graph` — automation complexity context from Phase 03b
  - `sf_architecture.narrative.system_overview` — how the automation works together from Phase 03c
  - `sf_architecture.transaction_analysis` — transaction boundaries from Phase 03c
  - `synthesis.unified_truth` — cumulative understanding from all prior phases

MA2 [GEN]: State the mission: *"I am documenting the platform landscape for **{{scope.feature_area}}** — security model, integrations, data volumes, and deployment history for {{scope.sf_objects | join(", ")}}. Business context: {{ado_research.business_context.feature_purpose | truncate(100)}}. Schema has {{sf_schema.objects | length}} objects with {{sf_schema.pii_fields | length}} PII fields. Automation has {{sf_automation.dependency_graph.stats.total_nodes}} components with max cascade depth of {{sf_architecture.execution_summary.max_cascade_depth}}. I need to document who can access this data, how it connects to external systems, and the data landscape of this feature."*

MA3: **Carry this context through every stream.** When documenting security, cross-reference with the PII fields from Phase 03a. When mapping integrations, connect them to the automation inventory from Phase 03b. When documenting data volumes, provide the factual record counts and freshness dates.

## Platform Output Structure
All outputs to `{{context_file}}.sf_platform`:
- `security` — `{ object_permissions[], field_permissions[], sharing_model{}, record_type_assignments[] }`
- `integrations` — `{ platform_events[], named_credentials[], connected_apps[], callout_patterns[], cdc_subscriptions[] }`
- `data_landscape` — `{ volumes[], record_type_distribution[], data_quality{}, data_freshness[], deployment_history[] }`

## Stream 1 [CLI/GEN] – Security and Access
**Goal:** Document who can access **{{scope.feature_area}}** data and with what permissions → `{{context_file}}.sf_platform.security`

### Object Permissions
B1 [CLI]: For each in-scope object:
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, Parent.Profile.Name, Parent.Label, Parent.IsOwnedByProfile, SobjectType, PermissionsRead, PermissionsCreate, PermissionsEdit, PermissionsDelete, PermissionsViewAllRecords, PermissionsModifyAllRecords FROM ObjectPermissions WHERE SobjectType = '{{object}}'" --tooling --json`
B2 [GEN]: Parse results into:
  - `object_permissions[]`: `{ object, parent_name, parent_type (Profile|PermissionSet), read, create, edit, delete, view_all, modify_all }`
  - Separate Profile-based permissions from Permission Set-based permissions
B3 [GEN]: List profiles/permission sets with elevated access (ModifyAll, ViewAll, Delete)

### Field-Level Security
B4 [CLI]: For each in-scope object (prioritize objects with PII fields from `sf_schema.pii_fields[]`):
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, Parent.Profile.Name, Parent.Label, Parent.IsOwnedByProfile, SobjectType, Field, PermissionsRead, PermissionsEdit FROM FieldPermissions WHERE SobjectType = '{{object}}'" --tooling --json`
B5 [GEN]: Parse into `field_permissions[]`:
  - `{ object, field, parent_name, parent_type, read, edit }`
B6 [GEN]: Cross-reference with `sf_schema.pii_fields[]`:
  - List which profiles/permission sets can read each PII field
  - List which profiles/permission sets can edit each PII field

### Sharing Model
B7 [CLI]: `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT QualifiedApiName, ExternalSharingModel, InternalSharingModel FROM EntityDefinition WHERE QualifiedApiName IN ('{{obj1}}','{{obj2}}')" --tooling --json`
B8 [GEN]: For each object, extract:
  - OWD (Organization-Wide Default): Private, Public Read Only, Public Read/Write, Controlled by Parent
  - Internal vs External sharing model
B9 [GEN]: Build `sharing_model{}`:
  - `{ object, internal_owd, external_owd, sharing_rules_exist (boolean), notes }`

### Record Type Assignments
B10 [CLI]: For objects with record types (from `sf_schema.record_types[]`):
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, RecordType.DeveloperName, Profile.Name FROM RecordTypeAssignment WHERE SobjectType = '{{object}}' AND IsActive = true" --tooling --json`
B11 [GEN]: Build `record_type_assignments[]`:
  - `{ object, record_type, profile, is_default }`

---

## Stream 2 [CLI/GEN] – Integrations and Events
**Goal:** Document how **{{scope.feature_area}}** connects to external systems and uses event-driven architecture → `{{context_file}}.sf_platform.integrations`

### Platform Events
C1 [CLI]: `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, DeveloperName, MasterLabel, Description FROM EntityDefinition WHERE IsCustomizable = true AND QualifiedApiName LIKE '%__e'" --tooling --json`
C2 [GEN]: Filter to events relevant to in-scope objects:
  - Name contains scope object name or feature area keywords
  - Referenced in `sf_automation.apex_classes[].event_publishes[]`
  - Referenced in `sf_automation.flows[]` where type = Platform Event-Triggered
C3 [GEN]: For each relevant event, store:
  - `{ api_name, label, description, publishers[] (Apex classes/flows that publish), subscribers[] (flows/triggers that subscribe) }`

### Event Publishers in Apex
C4 [IO]: Load `sf_automation.apex_classes[]` — filter for classes with `callout_references[]` or `event_publishes[]`
C5 [GEN]: Cross-reference Apex event publish statements with discovered platform events

### Named Credentials
C6 [CLI]: `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, DeveloperName, MasterLabel, Endpoint FROM NamedCredential" --tooling --json`
C7 [GEN]: Identify named credentials referenced by in-scope Apex classes (from callout patterns):
  - `{ developer_name, label, endpoint, referenced_by[] (Apex class names) }`

### Connected Apps
C8 [CLI]: `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, Name, Description FROM ConnectedApplication" --tooling --json`
C9 [GEN]: Note connected apps that may relate to the feature area (by name/description match)

### Callout Pattern Summary
C10 [IO]: Load `sf_automation.apex_classes[].callout_references[]` from phase 03b
C11 [GEN]: Consolidate callout patterns:
  - `{ apex_class, callout_type (REST/SOAP/HTTP), named_credential, endpoint_pattern, direction (inbound/outbound) }`

### Change Data Capture
C12 [CLI]: `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, DurableId, QualifiedApiName FROM EntityDefinition WHERE QualifiedApiName IN ('{{obj1}}ChangeEvent','{{obj2}}ChangeEvent')" --tooling --json`
C13 [GEN]: Identify objects with CDC enabled → `cdc_subscriptions[]`

---

## Stream 3 [CLI/GEN] – Data Landscape
**Goal:** Document the operational data profile of **{{scope.feature_area}}** — volumes, field population, freshness, and recent deployment activity → `{{context_file}}.sf_platform.data_landscape`

### Record Volumes
D1 [CLI]: For each in-scope object:
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT COUNT() FROM {{object}}" --json`
D2 [GEN]: Store `volumes[]`: `{ object, record_count, assessed_at }`

### Record Type Distribution
D3 [CLI]: For objects with record types:
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT RecordType.DeveloperName, COUNT(Id) cnt FROM {{object}} GROUP BY RecordType.DeveloperName" --json`
D4 [GEN]: Store `record_type_distribution[]`:
  - `{ object, record_type, count, percentage }`

### Data Quality Indicators
D5 [CLI]: For key fields (required fields, commonly used fields — max 10 queries per object):
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM {{object}} WHERE {{field}} != null" --json`
D6 [GEN]: Calculate population rate: `(non_null_count / total_count) * 100`
D7 [GEN]: Build `data_quality{}`:
  - `field_population[]`: `{ object, field, population_rate, total_records, populated_records }`
  - Note population rates for all queried fields including required fields

### Data Freshness
D8 [CLI]: For each in-scope object:
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate FROM {{object}} ORDER BY LastModifiedDate DESC LIMIT 1" --json`
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT Id, CreatedDate FROM {{object}} ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 1" --json`
D9 [GEN]: Store `data_freshness[]`:
  - `{ object, last_modified, last_created, freshness_status (active/stale/dormant) }`
  - Active: modified within 7 days
  - Stale: modified 7–90 days ago
  - Dormant: no modifications in 90+ days

### Deployment History
D10 [CLI]: For each in-scope object (combine into single query if possible):
  - `{{cli.sf_query}} "SELECT CreatedDate, CreatedBy.Name, Display, Section, Action FROM SetupAuditTrail WHERE Display LIKE '%{{object}}%' ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 30" --json`
D11 [GEN]: Store `deployment_history[]`:
  - `{ object, date, user, action, detail }`
  - Summarize deployment frequency and recent changes

---

## Completion [IO/GEN]
Update `{{context_file}}`:
- `metadata.phases_completed` append `"sf_platform"`
- `metadata.current_phase` = `"documentation"`
- `metadata.last_updated` = ISO timestamp
- Extend `synthesis.unified_truth` with:
  - `security_summary` — profile/permission set count with access, OWD overview, PII field access counts
  - `integration_summary` — platform event count, named credential count, callout pattern count
  - `data_summary` — total record count across objects, freshness status distribution, field population rates
  - `deployment_activity` — summary of recent deployment history
- Append `{"phase":"sf_platform","step":"complete","completedAt":"<ISO>","artifact":"{{context_file}}"}` to `run_state.completed_steps[]`
- Save to disk

Tell user: **"Platform discovery for {{scope.feature_area}} complete. Security model ({{profile_count}} profiles with access), {{event_count}} integrations/events, and data landscape ({{total_records}} total records) documented. All Salesforce discovery phases (03a–03d) done — use `/feature-research-phase-05` to generate the documentation report."**

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Context file missing | **STOP** — "Run `/feature-research-phase-01` first" |
| Phase 03c not completed | **STOP** — "Run `/feature-research-phase-03c` first" |
| Tooling API query fails | Log error; try alternative query approach; continue with partial data |
| ObjectPermissions query returns 0 | Object may use Controlled by Parent OWD; note in sharing_model |
| FieldPermissions query too large | Limit to PII fields + key custom fields; note partial coverage |
| SetupAuditTrail has no entries | Object may be stable (no recent changes); note in deployment_history |
| Record count query fails | May be permissions issue; log error; estimate from other indicators |
| Named Credential query restricted | Log; note security limitation; continue |
| CDC entity not found | CDC not enabled for this object; log as normal finding |
